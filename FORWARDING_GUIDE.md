# 📧 SIBOU3AZA Email Forwarding System Guide

**The Revolutionary Way to Send Mass Emails - Just Forward from Your Inbox!**

## 🚀 What is the Forwarding System?

The SIBOU3AZA Email Forwarding System allows you to send professional mass emails by simply forwarding them from your personal email (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) to your domain. No more complex EML files or technical setup - just compose and forward!

## 🎯 How It Works

```
Your Gmail → forward@yourdomain.com → SIBOU3AZA → Your Entire Mailing List
```

1. **Compose** your email in Gmail/Outlook as usual
2. **Send** it to your forwarding address (e.g., `forward@yourdomain.com`)
3. **SIBOU3AZA automatically** processes and forwards to your entire mailing list
4. **Track** delivery with full statistics and monitoring

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### **Step 1: Complete Initial Setup**
```bash
# Run the enhanced setup
sudo ./setup_mailer.sh
```

During setup, configure:
- **Domain name**: `yourdomain.com`
- **Forwarding email**: `forward@yourdomain.com` (or any prefix you want)
- **Sender details**: Your business name and email
- **Email list file**: Path to your subscriber list

### **Step 2: Configure DNS Records**
Add the DNS records shown during setup to your domain:
- **SPF Record**: Authenticates your sending IP
- **DKIM Record**: Digital signature for authenticity
- **DMARC Record**: Email policy for deliverability

### **Step 3: Verify Setup**
```bash
# Verify DNS records
./verify_domain.sh yourdomain.com

# Should show all ✓ green checkmarks
```

### **Step 4: Start Forwarding System**
```bash
# Start the email forwarding system
./start_forwarding.sh
```

This starts the background monitoring service that watches for incoming emails.
