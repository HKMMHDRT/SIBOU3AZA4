# ðŸ”§ Email Delivery Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Emails Show as Successful but Not Received

This guide helps diagnose why your SIBOU3AZA3 system shows 100% success but emails aren't being delivered.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Diagnosis Steps

### 1. **Test the Fixed System**
Your system has been updated with:
- âœ… Proper configuration file handling
- âœ… Domain verification on startup
- âœ… Fixed HTML email template
- âœ… Fixed script syntax errors

Run the bulk sender again:
```bash
./send_bulk_email.sh template.html
```

The script will now:
- Prompt for your domain name
- Verify DNS records before proceeding
- Create proper email structure
- Show better error reporting

### 2. **Run Email Delivery Test**
Execute the test script to diagnose delivery issues:
```bash
chmod +x test_email_delivery.sh
./test_email_delivery.sh
```

This will check:
- Postfix service status
- Mail queue status
- Mail logs
- DNS resolution
- Configuration issues

### 3. **Check Mail Logs** 
Monitor real-time mail delivery:
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/mail.log
```

Look for:
- `sent` - successful delivery
- `bounced` - delivery failed
- `rejected` - recipient server rejected
- `timeout` - connection issues

### 4. **Check Mail Queue**
See if emails are stuck:
```bash
mailq
```

- Empty queue = emails delivered
- Emails in queue = delivery issues

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: Port 25 Blocked (Most Likely)**
**Symptoms:** Script shows success, but no emails delivered
**Cause:** Cloud providers often block port 25
**Solution:** Use SMTP relay

```bash
# Check if port 25 is blocked
telnet smtp.gmail.com 587
# If this fails, port 25 is likely blocked
```

**Fix with Gmail SMTP Relay:**
1. Edit `/etc/postfix/main.cf`
2. Add these lines:
```
relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
smtp_use_tls = yes
```

3. Create credentials file:
```bash
echo "[smtp.gmail.com]:587 youremail@gmail.com:yourapppassword" | sudo tee /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
sudo systemctl restart postfix
```

### **Issue 2: DNS Issues**
**Symptoms:** DNS verification passes but no delivery
**Check:**
```bash
dig MX yourdomain.com
dig TXT yourdomain.com
```

### **Issue 3: IP Reputation**
**Symptoms:** Emails rejected by recipient servers
**Check:**
```bash
# Check if your IP is blacklisted
curl -s "http://multirbl.valli.org/lookup/$(curl -s ifconfig.me).html"
```

### **Issue 4: Postfix Not Running**
**Check:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status postfix
```

**Fix:**
```bash
sudo systemctl start postfix
sudo systemctl enable postfix
```

## ðŸ“Š Testing Steps

### **Step 1: Small Test**
1. Create test email list with 2-3 emails
2. Run: `./send_bulk_email.sh template.html`
3. Check mail logs immediately

### **Step 2: Mail Tester Verification**
1. Go to https://www.mail-tester.com/
2. Get a test email address
3. Send to that address
4. Check spam score and delivery report

### **Step 3: Real Email Test**
1. Send to your personal Gmail/Yahoo
2. Check inbox and spam folder
3. Verify email formatting

## âš¡ Quick Fix Commands

```bash
# 1. Restart mail services
sudo systemctl restart postfix
sudo systemctl restart opendkim

# 2. Clear mail queue
sudo postsuper -d ALL

# 3. Check mail logs
sudo tail -20 /var/log/mail.log

# 4. Test DNS
./verify_domain.sh yourdomain.com

# 5. Check queue
mailq

# 6. Test connectivity
telnet gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com 25
```

## ðŸ“ž Next Steps

1. **Run the updated bulk sender** - it now includes better error handling
2. **Execute the test script** - `./test_email_delivery.sh`
3. **Check mail logs** - `sudo tail -f /var/log/mail.log`
4. **If port 25 is blocked** - implement SMTP relay (most likely solution)

## ðŸ’¡ Success Indicators

- âœ… Mail logs show "sent" messages
- âœ… Empty mail queue (`mailq` shows no emails)
- âœ… Test emails received in inbox
- âœ… No bounces or rejections in logs

The system was working yesterday with 10k emails, so the infrastructure is capable. These fixes should restore functionality.
